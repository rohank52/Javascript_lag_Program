JavaScript - Theory Reference Document

#1 Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

Primarily used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites.

Runs on the client side in the browser, but can also run on the server side (Node.js).

#2 Key Features

Scripting Language: Designed for web development and scripting.

Interpreted: No need for compilation.

Dynamic Typing: Variable types are determined at runtime.

First-Class Functions: Functions are treated as objects.

Prototype-Based: Inheritance is based on prototypes, not classes.

Event-Driven: Commonly used with event listeners for interactive applications.

#3 JavaScript Execution Environment

Browser: Runs using JavaScript Engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome).

Node.js: Server-side runtime for building scalable network applications.

#4 Variables and Data Types

Declared using var, let, and const.

Primitive Types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt.

Non-Primitive Types: Object, Array, Function.

#5 Operators

Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise, Ternary, and Type operators.

#6 Control Structures

Conditional: if, else, else if, switch.

Loops: for, while, do-while, for-in, for-of.

Branching: break, continue, return.

#7 Functions and Scope

Function declarations and expressions.

Arrow Functions for concise syntax.

Lexical scope and closures.

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).

#8 Objects and Prototypes

Objects are collections of key-value pairs.

Inheritance is achieved via prototype chaining.

Object.create(), constructor functions, and ES6 classes.

#9 DOM Manipulation

Document Object Model: Interface to access and change the structure, style, and content of web documents.

Methods: getElementById, querySelector, createElement, appendChild, etc.

#10 Event Handling

JavaScript responds to user actions using event listeners.

Events include click, mouseover, keydown, etc.

addEventListener is commonly used to handle events.

#11 ES6 and Beyond

New features include let, const, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, promises, async/await, modules.

#12 Flexibility and Modern Use

JavaScript is incredibly flexible and forms the foundation of modern web frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.

Compatible with CSS for styling and HTML for structure, enabling full-stack development.

This reference document outlines the theoretical concepts of JavaScript. It's ideal for quick revision or conceptual learning without diving into code.
